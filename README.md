# WORDCLOUD-GTK #
#################

A gtk+ word counter and wordcloud creator written in python (2.7).

It can count words and create a list and wordcloud type image from a typical .txt file.
It can also create a part-of-speech list and wordcloud using nltk but this is not yet very human readable.
